# Solo Project for Jerry Anderson 

## Overview

My proposed project is a something I would like to build for my job as an Engineer on the Emerging Tech Team at Cisco Systems. A common issue for Engineers that work on DNA Center (DNAC) is having to write templates from scratch for several use cases. I would like to create an app that allows Engineers to save template configurations for future use as well as enabling Engineers to share their templates that may be helpful to other Engineers.

## Technical Specs

- Python
- MVC Pattern
- Flask Framework
- CSS Bootstrap
- SQL (would like to try to learn to use PostgreSQL but may not depending on time)

## Version 0.1

- Secure and validated login/register page using bcrypt and back end logic
- Individual user dashboard via protected route with the ability to choose view, edit or delete any templates they have submitted
- Index of all templates avaible submitted by all users

## Roadmap

- Keyword search (possibly tags if I can figure it out)
- Comment section so Engineers can get feedback
- A 'This helped' button or possibly an upvote/downvote system
